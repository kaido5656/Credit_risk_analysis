# Credit_risk_analysis

### Purpose
  The purpose of this exercise was to utilize imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling data that would lead to apply machine learning to manage credit-risk. Using a credit card credit dataset from LendingClub lending services the analysis will use six different types algorithms and methods to determine which method provides applicable results.
  
### Results
  ![1oversam](images/1oversam.PNG)
  ##### Using the random oversampling data above we can see that accuracy is about 66% and the low risk precision is notably 100% drawing skepticism to this this machine learning model overall. The recall for both high risk and lowrisk are both within acceptable bounds.

  ##### The above data was retrieved using the smote machine learning model. The accuracy is 63% and both the presicion and recall are similar to the random sampling method previously done, albeit worse for the recall.
